  Are you looking for a way to add riddles to your application? Rather than build the feature yourself, you can use this pre-built API. The Riddles API can return riddles from a variety of categories. Current categories include easy, hard, kids, math, word, and funny. Request one random riddle or request them all! Riddles in the original database are from [https://parade.com/947956/parade/riddles/](https://parade.com/947956/parade/riddles/). New riddles can be added and updated via the API.
