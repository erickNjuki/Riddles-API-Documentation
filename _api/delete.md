  ðŸ“Œ To delete a riddle from the database

    | HTTP Method | Endpoint | Summary                            |
    | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
    | `DELETE`    | /riddles | Deletes a riddle from the database |

    Select a Riddle object to delete by setting the query parameter to its `id`. Currently, deleting seed data (the initial riddles added to the database) is not allowed.

    The query parameter is defined as:

    | Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                     |
    | --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | id        | string | Required | The database `id` for the riddle. This is needed for `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` requests which are operations performed on an existing riddle. |

    {: .success }
  **Example request**

    A curl request to delete a riddle:

    ```
    curl -X DELETE 'https://riddlesapidoc.vercel.app/riddles?id=60bc3adb1e6946b94ca7a70a'
    ```

    A successful response will return an HTTP status code of `200` and have the following schema:

    | Field   | Type   | Description             |
    | ------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
    | message | string | A brief success message |


    {: .success }
  **Example response**

  A successful response to a DELETE request:

    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
    "message": Successfully deleted riddle"
    }
    ```

    {: .error }
    **Possible error responses**

    A `DELETE` request to the /riddles endpoint may return the following errors:

    | Error code | Description                                                                                                              |
    | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | 403        | `Forbidden`: This error will be returned if you try to delete the seed data (the initial riddles added to the database). |
    | 404        | `Not Found`: This error will occur if the requested riddle `id` is not found in the database.                            |
    | 500        | `Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server.
